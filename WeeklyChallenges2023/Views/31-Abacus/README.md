# Challenge 31 - Abacus

Write a function that is capable of reading the number represented by the abacus.

- The abacus is represented by an array with 7 
- Each element will have 9 "O"s (although it usually has 10 to perform operations) for the beads and a sequence of "---" for the wire.
- The first element of the array represents the millions, and the last the units.
- The number on each element is represented by the beads that are to the left of the wire.
