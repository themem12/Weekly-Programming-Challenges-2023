# Challenge 42 - Meeting point

Write a function that calculates the meeting point of two moving objects in two dimensions.

- Each object is composed of an xy coordinate and a displacement speed (displacement vector) per unit of time (also in xy format).
- The function will receive the start coordinates of both objects and their speeds. It will take them a while to achieve it.
- The function must take into account that objects may not be found.
