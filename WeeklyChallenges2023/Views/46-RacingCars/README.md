# Challenge 46 - Racing cars

Write a program that simulates the competition of two cars on a track.

- The two cars will be represented by 🚙 and 🚗. And the goal for 🏁.
- Each track will have between 1 and 3 trees 🌲 placed randomly.
- The two tracks will have a configurable length of underscores "_".
- The cars will start on the right side of the tracks. Example:
   🏁____🌲_____🚙
   🏁_🌲____🌲___🚗
 
 The game takes place automatically in turns, and every second an action is performed on the cars (moving at the same time), until one of them (or both at the same time) reaches the finish line.

- Actions:
  - Advance between 1 to 3 positions towards the goal.
  - If the car ends up in a tree position when moving forward, 💥 is displayed and does not move forward for a turn.
  - Each turn the clues and their elements are printed.
  - When the race ends, the winning car or the tie is shown.
