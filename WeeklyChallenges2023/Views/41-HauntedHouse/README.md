# Challenge 41 - Haunted house

This is a special challenge for Halloween.
You find yourself exploring an abandoned mansion full of rooms.
In each room you will have to solve a puzzle to advance to the next one.
Your mission is to find the candy room.

It is about implementing an interactive question and answer game per terminal. (You have complete freedom to be creative with the texts)

- 🏰 House: The mansion corresponds to a 4 x 4 square structure that you must model. The door and sweet rooms have no enigma. (16 rooms, one being the entrance and another where the sweets are)
- ❓ Enigmas: Each room proposes a random enigma that you must answer with text. If you don't get it right you won't be able to move.
- 🧭 Movement: If you solve the puzzle you will be asked where you want to go. (Example: north/south/east/west. Only possible options should be provided)
- 🍭 Exit: You leave the house if you find the candy room.
- 👻 (Bonus) Ghosts: There is a 10% chance that a ghost will appear in a room and you will have to answer two questions to get out of it.
