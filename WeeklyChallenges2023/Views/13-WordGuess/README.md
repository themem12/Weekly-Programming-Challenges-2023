# Challenge 13 - Word guess

Write a program that lets the user guess words in a maximum number of tries:
 - The game starts showing an incomplete random word
 - For example "m_ur_d_v" and the number of tries remaining
 - The user only can write a letter or a word (from the same lenght of the word to guess)
 - If the user wrote a correct letter, it should show that letter in the word. If it fails it must remove one try
 - If he writes the correct word, the game is over. If the word is wrong, it must remove one try
 - If the counter reach 0, it's game over
 - The word must hide random letters and must show at least 60%
