# Challenge 2 - Tennis game

Write a program that shows how a tennis game takes place and who has won it.
 The program will receive a sequence made up of "P1" (Player 1) or "P2" (Player 2), depending on who wins each point in the game.
 
 - The scores of a game are "Love" (zero), 15, 30, 40, "Deuce" (tie), advantage.
 - Given the sequence [P1, P1, P2, P2, P1, P2, P1, P1], the program would show the following:
   - 15 - Love
   - 30 - Love
   - 30 - 15
   - 30 - 30
   - 40 - 30
   -deuce
   - Advantage P1
   - Has won P1
 - If you want, you can control errors in data entry.
 - Consult the rules of the game if you have doubts about the point system.
