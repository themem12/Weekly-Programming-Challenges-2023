# Challenge 44 - Math quiz

Write an interactive terminal game in which you will have to guess the result of different random mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication or division of two integers).

- You will have 3 seconds to answer correctly.
- The game ends if you cannot respond within that time.
- At the end of the game you must show how many calculations you have got right.
- Every 5 correct answers you must increase the possible number of figures of the operation by one (each time by one operand):
  - Questions 1 to 5: X (between 0 and 9) operation Y (between 0 and 9)
  - Questions 6 to 10: XX (between 0 and 99) operation Y (between 0 and 9)
  - Questions 11 to 15: XX operation YY
  - Questions 16 to 20: XXX (between 0 and 999) YY operation
