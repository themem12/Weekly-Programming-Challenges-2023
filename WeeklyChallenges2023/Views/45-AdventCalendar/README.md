# Challenge 45 - Advent calendar

Write a program that simulates the participation mechanism:

- Using the terminal, the program will ask you if you want to add and delete participants, show them, launch the draw or exit.
- If you select to add a participant, you will be able to write their name and press enter.
- If you select to add a participant, and it already exists, you will be notified of this. (And you won't duplicate it)
- If you select show participants, all of them will be listed.
- If you select to delete a participant, you can type their name and press enter. (Warning if you have deleted it or the name does not exist)
- If you select to carry out the drawing, you will choose a person at random and they will be removed from the list.
- If you select exit, the program will end.
